    <p style= 'font-family:courier;'>I remember the day when my dad came back from work with three train tickets to Kerala. It was a cold winter night, and I was back home for a short winter break in between the semester. My dad just dropped the plan to me, and my mom all of a sudden, and my dad said that he just went by instinct while reading some stories about Padmanavaswami Temple in the very evening. My mom and I didn't complain because we knew that a proper trip is sporadic in a business family. But the surprise was still waiting for us when I asked when we should return as the Presidency Alumni Meet was almost around the corner. My dad said, " I didn't get any return ticket. But why do you worry so much? Let's just go and hit the street of Kerala. Stay until we fully cherish the southern part of the country". I was not convinced to go to an unknown place without proper planning, a place to stay. He said, "Toke south India ghoraboi. Chol. Internet use korte janis toh. Taholei hobe".<br><br>
The next 19 days, starting from the 9th of Dec, 2014, were just not a trip. The first unplanned trip that has become one of sweetest memory with my family. We were lost in the street, traveled the whole journey using public transport, and experienced a truly diverse life across the west coast of Kerala.<br><br>
      This photo was from Alleppy, Kerala. I can't express how peaceful it was to be on a boat, floating through the backwater without knowing the next destination. The trip actually made me go places in the coming days with minimal planning to experience the purest form of culture, life trivia, and traveling.
